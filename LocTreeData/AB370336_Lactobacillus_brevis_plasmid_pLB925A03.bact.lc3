# Localization Prediction using LocTree3
# Domain: bact
#
# NOTATION Protein Id: Fasta sequences Id truncated by whitespace
# NOTATION Score: Reliability score on a 0-100 scale (0=unreliable & 100=most reliable)
# NOTATION Localization: Predicted sub-cellular localization class
# NOTATION Gene Ontology Terms: Gene Ontology (GO) term/s of the corresponding localization. GO terms predicted by PSI-BLAST are supported by evidence codes (see http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml)
